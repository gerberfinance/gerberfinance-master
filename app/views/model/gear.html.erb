	<h3 class="head">Top things you can do (and avoid) to secure a line of credit for your growing business</h3>
		<p class="head4">
			<em>First impressions are critical to any relationship, especially when it involves 
			something as important as your business and your lender's capital. Gerber Finance CEO 
			Gerald Joseph weighs in on what lenders are looking for when they meet borrowers and how 
			to strike the best deal.</em>
		</p>
			
			<h4 class="head5">1. Be prepared</h4>
				<p class="head1">You know your business better than anyone, and a good lender will care just as much 
				as you do about the smallest details. So, be prepared for full disclosure of the best 
				and worst parts of your company's past, present and future.
				<br />
				<br />
				It is hugely comforting for a lender to hear a prospective borrower have a good handle 
				on both the industry and the company.
				<br />
				<br />
				Have key financial numbers on hand and critical team members on call and if you don't 
				have the answer to a specific question, don't be afraid to say so. I don't know but 
				will get back to you has been the hallmark of some of the smartest businesspeople we know.
				</p>
			<h4 class="head5">2. Be specific about what you need</h4>
			    <p class="head1">We want to know your story and will be ready to appreciate your business as much as you 
			    do - but don't forget why we are here.<br />
				<br />
				One of the first things a lender wants to hear is what you need &ndash; and what you need 
				it for. Everything we discuss will relate back to &ldquo;how much and what for&rdquo; &ndash; 
				so spell it out up front.
				<br />
				<br />
				And be realistic. Unless you have just landed a big order, asking for a $5 million line of credit 
				when annual sales are $3 million, does not win any points with your prospective lender.
				<br />
				<br />
			<h4 class="head5">3. Be candid: we can only make good decisions with all of the information</h4>
			    <p class="head1">Contrary to popular belief, it&rsquo;s not all about the money. The best borrower/lender 
			    relationships are built upon trust and opportunity for mutual success. So be brutally frank 
			    and honest about the business and the principals &ndash; at the first meeting and throughout 
			    the relationship.
			    <br />
				<br />What are your successes and failures?  What difficulties have you faced and how have 
				you overcome them? What challenges do you face today and how are you dealing with them on a 
				day-to-day basis?
				<br />
				<br />
				If you can share past and current problems with the lender up front and you do not scare 
				him or her off, it&rsquo;s a positive sign. And if you do scare your lender off at that 
				first meeting, well, that was not the lender for you.
				<br />
				<br />
				You deserve a lender that knows your successes and your failures &ndash; and will be with 
				you in the trenches to help you succeed.
				<br />
				<br />
				Also remember that any decent lender will independently verify your facts, and if you&rsquo;ve 
				painted a rosier-than-reality picture, you may have lost that lender&rsquo;s trust forever.
				<br />
				</p>	
			<h4 class="head5">4. Prepare a solid package</h4>
			    <p class="head1">Give your prospective lender a detailed package of information to help speed up the process 
			    of getting the loan and make a great impression in the process. While each loan will be 
			    slightly different, the following key will help you prepare the essentials.
			    <br />
                <br />
			    For an asset based line of credit, provide at least the following:
			    </p>
			    	<ul>
			      		<li class=head_ul>3 years of year-end financial statements, current year-to-date internally produced 
			      		financial statements</li>
			      		<li class=head_ul>Current aged listing of receivables, current inventory report and if it can be 
			      		aged, an aged inventory report, aged payables list</li>
			      		<li class=head_ul>Resum&eacute;s of the management/officers, current and updated personal financial 
			      		statements of the guarantors and a huge winner, a budget and cash flow &ndash; and 
			      		please do NOT suggest to the lender that in YOUR business it is impossible to budget! 
			      		Remember, budgets are essentially estimates and everyone can make an estimate &ndash; 
			      		that way you can have something to measure your performance against and give you a 
			      		great indicator of what you need to do to be a success.</li>
			      	</ul>
			    <p class="head1">Above all, as you prepare this package, be realistic about the value of your investment and 
			    assets. Ridiculous valuations of the investment in the business on the guarantors&rsquo; 
			    personal financial statements are unimpressive to a lender. 
			    <br />
			    <br />
			    </p>
			<h4 class="head5">5. Negotiating the terms of the loan &amp; Lender Due Diligence</h4>
				<p class="head1">
				This is a critical time for your future relationship with your lender. If you&rsquo;ve come 
				this far, you understand the value a loan will have to the growth of your business. 
				Don&rsquo;t forget that as we enter this grueling stage together!<br />
				<br />
				As lenders, we know that all of the discovery, fact checking and due diligence can be tedious 
				&ndash; but it is for the benefit of an efficient relationship moving forward. If a lender 
				knows everything up front, and can trust you moving forward, your day-to-day dealings once 
				the loan is approved will be far more effective.
				<br />
				<br />
				</p>
				
			<h4 class="head5">6. Moving forward: how to keep your lender happy as your business grows</h4>
			    <p class="head1">
			    The loan is approved and you have signed a whole bunch of documents. And included in those 
			    documents are the terms and conditions that govern the loan. Take those terms and conditions 
			    seriously and adhere to them. They are all that protect the lender once you get the money 
			    &ndash; so treat them with as much respect as you would documents that protect your own business. 
			    In a sense, they do!
			    <br />
				<br />Remember that the best end game for you is to have a lender who trusts you, and a line 
				of credit that will help your business grow. Let this goal guide you through the process, 
				because when your financials are healthy, you can concentrate on building to the next level.
				<br />
